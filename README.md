Clinical and biological data classification has applications in several areas such as the diagnosis, estimation and prognosis of diseases. It is one of the most challenging problems in the field of machine learning, and one of the most critical problems in medicine. In order to address this issue, we propose a new method based on a combination of an ANN and the WCC algorithm in order to classify a clinical dataset.




# data set
In this article, we have used the biological and real clinical data sets used in various papers. diseases dataset such as heart, lung and cancer. These data sets have different characteristics, some of them are numerous sampels and some have many features. Some of these data sets are bainery classification and others are multi classification (The number of their labels is not low).
In these data sets, some of data are missing values, which We removed the data associated with them. We used normalization and fuzzification methods to increase the accuracy of the remaining data.
Our method, which can be used for balanced or unbalanced data, was verified using nine real clinical and biological datasets and compared with two efficient optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that our method achieves better results than the other approaches. 



# code
We implemented ANNWCC in the MATLAB programing language.
we combined an artificial neural network (ANN) with a World Competitive Contests (WCC) algorithm, designing a model for each existing class using an ANN and then training it using WCC.
We then evaluated the performance of the algorithms in the various experiments and described their functionality. The criteria used for comparison of the algorithms were convergence, stability, error, the correlation between predicted labels and actual labels, accuracy, ac and specificity. The results forANNWCC algorithm were better than those of the others.
